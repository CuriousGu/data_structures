# Common Data Structures Repository

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of commonly used data structures implemented in Python, C++, and Rust. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about data structures or an experienced developer seeking reference implementations, this repository serves as a valuable resource.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of various data structures, including but not limited to:

- Lists (e.g., linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (e.g., binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree)
- Graphs (e.g., directed graph, weighted graph)
- Hash Tables
- And many more...

Each data structure is implemented in three different programming languages:

- **Python**: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python implementations offer clarity and ease of understanding.
- **C++**: Renowned for its efficiency and performance, C++ implementations are ideal for high-performance computing.
- **Rust**: Recognized for its safety and concurrency features, Rust implementations combine performance with memory safety.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on data structure categories. Within each category, you'll find subdirectories for each data structure. Each data structure directory contains implementations in Python, C++, and Rust, along with relevant documentation and test cases.
